# My-First-Webpage-Design
This is my first webpage design.  

This webpage was not part of a tutorial or instruction.  All of this is just based on what i would like a website to look like for the most part.

This will be a template to display products or a service that someone or a business offers.
The webpage is divided into sections and within each section it is divided into divs that are using a display of flex to be able to move around a bit more easily.  
The website is currently one page but more will be added to it throughtout this week.  
There are comments in the markup that explain each bit along with comments in the Stylesheet that explain each style.

The webpage currently has 7 sections including the header and footer starting with a quick about me summary of the business.  Almost all of the text is lorem10.

Then goes into a pricing section that has 3 different tiers which can be adjusted according to the businesses motto.

Following the pricing section is a short comment section that will showcase 3 comments made by users and can be adjusted to the businesses wants or needs and even completely removed if that is what is wanted.

The next section shows some of the products of the business with a title of the product and a short description of the product.

The blank section at the bottom will be some contact information and how one can go about acquring these products or services

then the footer which will be links and all that mumbo jumbo
